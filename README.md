# Evaluating the Impact of Environmental Familiarity and Intervention Strategies on Crowd Evacuation Dynamics in Emergency Situations
### _Agent-Based Modelling Course 2024 | MSc Computational Science (UvA/VU)_

This study uses agent-based modelling to investigate how environmental familiarity and 
and intervention strategies (such as disaster announcement, guides and exit signage) affect 
crowd dynamics during emergency evacuations. 

### Prerequisites
The following Python packages are needed to run the model:
1. **Mesa** (version 2.3.0)
2. **Numpy**
3. **SciPy**
4. **Pandas**
5. **Matplotlib**
6. **SAlib** (version 1.5.0)


### Visualizing the model
The model can be run and visualized by executing _social_force_model.py_ in the _social_force_model_ folder. The parameters can be changed in this file as needed.
